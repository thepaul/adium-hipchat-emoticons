Hipchat emoticon set for Adium
------------------------------

To use:

Check out this repository on your Mac. The "Hipchat.AdiumEmoticonSet" folder
should show up as a bundle if you have Adium installed. Just double-click on it
(or open it using ``/usr/bin/open``).

Alternatively, download the pack from `Adium Extras`_. Note that the Adium
Extras pack will tend to lag behind this repository.
